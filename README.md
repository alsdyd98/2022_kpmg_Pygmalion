## URL for API (During Competition)

[JSON]
http://20.194.102.116:5000/predict/data

You can get the carbon emission prediction by giving JSON file of information of phones to /predict/data.
JSON file should be the form like below.
  ```shell
  [{
    "product": "GalaxyS22-256GB",
    "display(ppi)": 425.0,
    "battery(mAh)": 3700.0,
    "mass(g)": 167.0,
    "storage(GB)": 256.0,
    "release(yr)": 2022,
    "price(USD)": 799.99,
    "brand": "Samsung"
   }]
   ```
  
[Single Query] 
Example URL : http://20.194.102.116:5000/predict/single?product=GalaxyS22-256GB&display=425&battery=3700&mass=167&storage=256&release=2022&price=799.99

You can also put a single query after /predict/single to receive carbon emission prediction.
The query should include information of product, display, battery, mass, storage, release, price for prediction.
